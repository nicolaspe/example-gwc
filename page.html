    <div class="example1" id="about">
        I am a girl who codes from Sumware, CA. I will be in the 12th grade in the fall,
        and I am looking forward to applying to colleges. I live at home with my mom, my brother,
        and my cat named Seymore. When I'm not coding, you can find me listening to music with my friends or reading.
